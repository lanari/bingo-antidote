XThermoTools Default File (Bingo-Antidote)                              [XTT_Min_TC55.txt]

This file contains the mineral list with the corresponding phases or solid-solution models 
in the database. Be aware that this file is case-sensitive; Edit with caution! 

Format:  

>1  [Block 1: for solid phases and solutions] 
MineralName		NbOxygens	NameinDB		[El1,El2,...]				[W1,W2,...]

Notes:
- [MineralName] and [NameinDB] 	Names (single string = no blanks!). The database must
							   	be adjusted accordingly; e.g. WHITE MICA is not 
							   	a valid name for the solid solution model
- [NbOxygens] 					is the number of oxygen atoms used to compute the 
								structural formula in the thermodynamic database
- [El1,El2,...] 				Elements used to calculate the residual between observed
								and modeled mineral compositions
- [W1,W2,...] 					Weights used to calculate the residual between observed
								and modeled mineral compositions

>2  [Block 1: for fluid, gases and melt solutions] 
SpecieName		NbOxygens	NameinDB		[El1,El2,...]				[W1,W2,...]

Notes:
- [MineralName]					is case-sensitive; use “Fluid” to define a new specie, 
								“Melt” for a melt model, “Oxygen” for oxygen and “Buffer”
								for an oxygen buffer 

### Update February 2018, PL, *SWOT*
	- The format of this file has changed (new: blocks >1 and >2) 
	- Fluid and Gas species and solutions (Description to be added later on)

! ONLY the following phases have been tested:
	- BIOTITE		Works fine for bio(TCC) with large discrepancies in Si and Al;
	- GARNET		Works fine for almandine reach garnets;
	- PLAGIOCLASE	OK
	- K-FELDSPAR	Seems good
